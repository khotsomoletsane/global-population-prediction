# Global Population Prediction Project

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting global population trends using historical data. The objective is to process, clean, and analyze population data to develop insights and actionable recommendations. The project was originally a capstone task that involved multiple stages of data preparation and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## ðŸ“‚ Data Sources


## Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel: Primary tool for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
- Basic Excel functions, pivot tables, charts, and trendline analysis were applied throughout the project.

##  Data Preparation and Cleaning

The project followed a structured data pipeline:

1. *Original Data Import*: Data was first imported from a .txt file into Microsoft Excel.
2. *Copy to Interim Sheet*: The original data was duplicated into a new sheet to preserve raw values.
3. *Filtering*: Only relevant rows were kept (such as data specific to global or country totals).
4. *Cleaning*:
   - Removed unnecessary columns and rows.
   - Handled blank cells.
   - Ensured uniform date formatting and consistent numerical representation.
5. *Final Sheet Creation*: Cleaned data was copied to a "Final" sheet for analysis and visualization.

## ðŸ“ˆ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Several EDA techniques were performed using Excel:

- *Descriptive Statistics*: Mean, growth rate, and historical comparisons.
- *Visualizations*:
  - Line charts to observe population growth over time.
  - Trendlines to detect growth patterns.
  - Highlighting regional vs. global changes.
- *Comparative Analysis*: Key years and events (like policy shifts or pandemics) were compared across time for population effects.

## Results

Key findings from the analysis include:

- A steady increase in global population over the past decades.
- Projected population growth continues but at a slowing rate in some regions.
- Urbanization and development appear strongly correlated with population trends.

## ðŸ’¡ Recommendations

Based on the insights gained:

- Governments and organizations should plan for sustainable urban expansion.
- Investments in education and healthcare can balance population growth and quality of life.
- Consider climate and resource planning alongside demographic trends.

## Limitations

- Excel has limited scale for large datasets.
- Manual cleaning steps can introduce bias or errors.
- The projection model is simplistic and doesn't factor in complex socio-economic variables.
